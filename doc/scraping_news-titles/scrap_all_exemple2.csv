2019-04-26 00:00:00;Does the Bank of England have a woman problem? - BBC News;Why has the UK's central bank never had a female governor and could this be about to change?;"Take a glance at a photo of the Bank of England's influential Monetary Policy Committee and its problem is immediately clear. The nine-strong committee look pretty similar: eight white men and one woman. This is the body that guides the UK economy. Their monthly votes on interest rates ultimately determine how far our money goes. Yet they don't look anything like many of the people whose lives they have so much influence over. Women make up half of the UK population, yet just one ninth of the Monetary Policy Committee. There is also not a single black, Asian or minority ethnic group (BAME) member. In fact, current governor Mark Carney is the 120th in a continuous line of white men to have headed the Bank. It's obvious the Bank has a diversity problem. Last month, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said the Bank was some way off its diversity targets for next year ""with little evidence the gap is closing quickly enough"". But in January, the Bank appointed two women: former Virgin Money boss Dame Jayne-Anne Gadhia and Banking Standards Board chair Dame Colette Bowe to its Financial Policy Committee. The Bank's chief operating officer Joanna Place also said: ""In terms of diversity and inclusion, we have done a lot more than just gender and ethnicity. ""We have a number of staff networks. We have inclusive events. We have a wellbeing policy. We have done a cognitive diversity survey. We have started to look at social mobility,"" she added. Many are hoping that the Bank's search for a new governor - which kicked off earlier this week - could herald the start of a new era with a female governor at the helm for the first time in its history. Labour MP Rachel Reeves, who chairs the business select committee and who was an economist at the Bank of England before becoming a politician, said now is the time for the Bank to act: ""We've had two women prime ministers and yet have had no women chancellors or Bank governors. ""The sad truth is that the Bank has not done enough to recruit, train and promote talented women. More needs to be done to bring forward a generation of women economists who can be considered for the top job."" But Wendy Carlin, a professor of economics at University College London, says the problem is not with the Bank of England, but the economics profession itself. ""If you google economists you'll get a great number of pictures of economists in suits holding up a financial chart. Those impressions are self-reproducing. If people only see men in suits then they don't think it's for them,"" she says. Statistics show that women are far less likely than men to study economics, let alone get a job in the sector.Just over a third of undergraduate economics students in the UK are women. The picture is similar in Australia and the US. Prof Carlin is leading an international project - the CORE project - to change the way economics is taught, with the aim of broadening its appeal. ""We're being much clearer that economics is about addressing the problems we face. Yes, it's about financial stability but it's also about inequality, the environmental future and work."" But, she cautions, work at this academic level will take time to filter through to the real world. ""It's crucial to widen the pool [of job candidates] as far as possible, but you've got to get people into the pool in the first place and that's what we're working on,"" she says. Dr Margaret Heffernan, author and the former chief executive of five businesses, says the lack of a women in the sector has become self-fulfilling, that because the profession is dominated by males they tend to ""promote and nurture male students"". ""Economics can be very excluding of women, sometimes unintentionally and sometimes intentionally. People with privilege don't happily give it up,"" she says. A recent survey by the American Economic Association of more than 9,200 economists suggests there are also deep-rooted problems. Some 30% of female economists said they felt discriminated against, compared with 12% of men. Women felt they were treated especially unfairly when it came to pay and promotion decisions. Dr Heffernan says the profession itself should try to make sure it is attracting the widest possible pool of applicants, warning that women often underestimate their abilities when it comes to applying for jobs. One chief executive she spoke to ran a series of different recruitment adverts for a senior position. She found the more junior she made the role sound, the higher the number of female applicants. ""How you word a job will define someone's right to apply. If you're not getting the right kind of applicants then describe the job differently and see what happens."" Recruitment firm Sapphire Partners has been asked to carry out the search for the new governor. The fact it describes itself as ""advocates for women in business"", and is run by five female partners, suggests this time there could be room for optimism. But Dr Heffernan also points out that women in senior positions currently get a lot more scrutiny than men, something that can put them off applying. ""The first woman in any post of visible power knows there's extra scrutiny that goes with it. ""Everyone wants to know what they're wearing, what their family and social life is like. Some are ambivalent about that."" Nonetheless, she says the more common females in power become the less this will happen because it will become normal rather than extraordinary. Does she think the next Bank of England governor could be a woman? ""I'm cautiously optimistic,"" she says.";News;"Employment; Bank of England; UK economy; ";https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-48062920

ESB Networks said power has been restored to more than 30,000 customers. The areas most affected were County Clare, west and north Kerry, west Limerick and parts of Tipperary. The damage was mainly due to trees falling on overhead lines. Thirty-three thousand customers were without power at one stage. Red weather warnings in place for some counties have been removed.  Met Éireann had also issued a gale warning for Saturday evening on Irish coastal waters, from Malin Head to Carlingford Lough to Wicklow Head and on the Irish Sea. A yellow rain warning was earlier in place across NI. It was kept in place until 15:00 BST on Saturday. Irish forecaster Met Éireann said gusts reached 122km; h (76mph) at Mace Head in County Galway. The last time a red alert was issued was for ex-hurricane Ophelia in October 2017.  The UK Met Office said some flooding of homes and traffic disruption could be expected in Northern Ireland on Saturday. Southern Wales and south-west England were also affected. The Met Office had warned of wind gusts reaching 60-70mph (97-113km; h) on exposed coastal stretches and 45-55mph (72-89km; h) inland from Friday evening into Saturday afternoon.

2019-04-26 00:00:00;Hundreds of thousands of viruses in oceans - BBC News;The oceans contain almost 200,000 different viral populations, according to the latest count.;"The oceans contain almost 200,000 different viral populations, according to the latest count. Marine viruses were found from the surface down to 4,000m deep and from the North to the South Pole. Though most are harmless to humans, they can infect marine life, including whales and crustaceans. And scientists are only just starting to understand how these tiny microbes play a role in the life and chemistry of the seas. Researchers at Ohio State University drew up a global map of marine viruses based on seawater samples from nearly 80 sites around the world. Their viral tally is almost 12-fold higher than previous estimates. They were surprised to find that the viruses fell into just five groups based on their location and depth. ""When we examined the genes of the viruses in each of those communities, we found evidence of genetic adaptation to the different zones of the ocean,"" said researcher Ann Gregory, now of KU Leuven in Belgium. The second surprise was that the Arctic Ocean had lots of different types of viruses. It had been thought that hotspots for microbial diversity would be at the equator. The world's oceans are teeming with viruses, yet we are at the edge of our understanding on how they impact ocean health and function. Among previous discoveries are ""giant"" marine viruses, which can infect green algae. A litre of seawater typically contains billions of viruses - the vast majority of which remain unidentified. In the latest dataset, 90% of the populations could not be classified to a known group. Better knowledge of ocean viruses is important because of their influence on other marine microbes, including bacteria and fungi. Viruses have an impact on organisms, such as plankton, which produce more than half of the oxygen we breathe and absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. ""Without microbes, the Earth, its oceans, and even our human bodies come to a halt,"" said Matthew Sullivan of Ohio State University. ""Our lab is helping researchers finally 'see' the hidden viruses that infect these microbes."" The study is reported in the journal Cell. Most of its data comes from the Tara Oceans expedition (2009-2013) using the 36m aluminium-hulled research schooner, Tara.

2019-04-26 00:00:00;Failed airline FlyBMI 'owed £37m' when it collapsed, say administrators - BBC News;The airline collapsed in February, owing millions to suppliers and passengers.;"The regional airline FlyBMI owed £37m when it collapsed. Most creditors, including passengers and suppliers who have lost out, may receive only 1% of their claims, say administrators. The airline cancelled all flights and filed for administration in February, blaming spikes in fuel and carbon costs and uncertainty over Brexit. Many of the airline's routes, aircraft and former staff have been taken on by its sister airline company, LoganAir. When FlyBMI filed for administration, passengers were due £3.8m under EU compensation rules, according to a statement of affairs from the company's directors. Passengers whose flights were cancelled were told to contact their travel agents or insurance or credit card companies for a refund. Rolls Royce was owed £2.25m for a servicing contract, the statement of affairs says. FlyBMI ran services for mainly business passengers between UK regional airports and continental European cities, including Munich, Frankfurt and Brussels. Stansted Airport and Bristol Airport were owed money by FlyBMI, according to a list of unsecured creditors to the airline. The carrier operated 17 aircraft, 14 of which were ""detained"" after the administration ""due to unpaid navigation service charges,"" according to the administrators. Parent company Airline Investments Limited (AIL) said the company made a loss of £6.8m in the year to 31 March 2018 and losses deepened during the rest of 2018. ""The company was also becoming increasingly concerned about the potential impact of Brexit and the ability to conduct intra-European flying whilst operating under a UK Operators Certificate,"" say the administrators BDO. BDO said FlyBMI's trading was worse than forecast at the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019 when FlyBMI's ultimate owners, the aviation entrepreneurs Peter and Stephen Bond, said they would stop funding FlyBMI. AIL said more than £40m had been invested in FlyBMI in the six years before its collapse. Many of FlyBMI's former routes, including those from Newcastle and Aberdeen, are now operated by LoganAir. The Scottish airline has also taken over several ""key"" contracts that FlyBMI used to operate, including one for Airbus and the route between Derry and London Stansted. ""Any airline is free to start routes as they see fit, and indeed one other airline has already announced services on a former BMI route too"", LoganAir's managing director Jonathan Hinkles told the BBC in February. Fifteen aircraft which carried FlyBMI livery are currently, or will soon be, operated by LoganAir. About 130 former FlyBMI pilots and cabin crew now work for LoganAir. Airport landing slots controlled by FlyBMI were ""transferred"" to LoganAir before administrators were appointed ""preventing the airports seeking to cancel them"", BDO says, adding that LoganAir is trying to sell the slots. The two airlines used to ""trade as sister airlines with their own management teams and brand identities but taking advantage of commercial, operational and procurement synergies"", according to AIL.";News;"Flybmi collapse; ";https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-48071724

2019-04-26 00:00:00;Should the colour of plasters match skin tones? - BBC News;A man receives an overwhelming response after sharing an image of a plaster that matched his skin tone.;"Who knew something as mundane as using a plaster could provoke such an emotional and lively debate about racial identity? That's what happened after Dom Apollon, 45, cut his finger at home in Oakland, California. On attaching the dark brown plaster, Dom who works for a non-profit racial awareness organisation, was overcome with emotions as he realised how it perfectly matched his own skin colour. Posting a picture on Twitter he wrote: ''It's taken me 45 trips around the sun, but for the first time in my life I know what it feels like to have a band-aid in my own skin tone,"" he said, referring to the plaster. ''You can barely even spot it in the first image. For real I'm holding back tears.'' In a heartfelt series of tweets, which have been shared 96,000 times, Dom expressed how the simple household item provoked questions about his own racial identity. ''Not like I didn't know these strips existed. But I definitely didn't expect the complex emotions that would swirl as I watched it just ... blend in. ''This felt like belonging. Like feeling valued. Sadness for my younger self and millions of kids of colour, especially black kids. ''Like a reminder of countless spaces where my skin is still not welcomed. Feared. Hated. ''Like, why am I really thinking all this 'bout an effing band-aid?"" he posted. The thread which has been liked half a million times caught the attention of actor John Boyega, who posted his own experience of ""nude"" plaster usage while on the set of Star Wars. ''An average day in an action film like Star Wars comes with jumps, falls, crashes and explosions etc. We patch up and keep it moving,'' he posted. Author Malorie Blackman also weighed in on the conversation. Her novel Noughts and Crosses is set in a world divided by race, where black people (Crosses) are the rulers and white people (Noughts) are the underclass. Plasters for different skin tones are available to buy, but many social media users admitted they were unaware they could purchase any other shade but the standard ""nude"" colour. ''Future teacher here! Adding these to my list of essential classroom supplies!'' posted one Twitter user. Others responded with their own examples of every day items they felt had in the past failed to represent them. ''Oh, man. The ""flesh"" crayon confused me so much when I was a kid, & my mom tried her best to help me find the crayon that matched me the best, but I remember being upset that nothing really worked,'' another user wrote. Another posted: ''I feel the same way about naming conventions for a variety of things: nude pantyhose, nude sandals, nude pumps, nude bras, you get the point.'' Others did not quite understand the point of the conversation. ''Um... it's just a bandage, man. When I was a kid I never really cared what colour it was. '' posted one Twitter user. Although items such as toys, tights, and crayons are available in different skin tones, some independent businesses are increasingly catering for people of different skin colours. In 2014 Ade Hassan founded Nubian Skin a range of lingerie and hosiery for women of colour. ""I could never find simple things like tights in my skin colour, and having something so simple like nude not represent you, can feel very exclusive, like you are an afterthought,"" she told the BBC. Similarly a range of ballet pump in different shades of bronze have also been created in the UK for the first time. Ballet Black, whose dancers are all of black and Asian descent, have worked alongside shoe manufacturer Freed to create the new shoes. Dancer Cira Robinson described what it meant to her to dance in ballet shoes that matched her skin colour: ''To have a shoe that I can just put on and go, I never thought that'd happen.''";News;"California; United States; ";https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/48060767
2019-04-26 00:00:00;Taking HIV drug PrEP 'doesn't mean you're promiscuous' - BBC News;A study will look at whether use of the HIV drug increases infection rates for other STIs.;"""Just because you're using PrEP, it doesn't mean you're putting it about."" For thousands of people like Chris Hicks, a 35-year-old DJ from Cardiff, HIV-prevention drug Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has diminished the fear around sex. New studies are looking at whether the drug could increase ""risky behaviour"" and infection rates for other STIs. Chris says that, while he's ""not always 100% safe"", he'd like to see some stigma around the drug disappear. ""Some people will automatically assume that, because you're on PrEP, you put it about quite a lot and you're very promiscuous, when really it's not,"" he said. ""You're just taking an extra precaution towards protecting yourself. It's just an added thing to go toward your usual safe-sex practices."" PrEP is provided on the NHS in Scotland, with a study being run in Wales and an impact trial involving thousands of people being rolled out in England. The drug has been hailed as a ""milestone"" in the battle against HIV.  But some research has suggested its use could lead to more cases of other STIs, such as syphilis and gonorrhoea. One study by the University of New South Wales in Australia found HIV-negative men using PrEP were more likely to have unprotected sex. Chris said that as a gay man who grew up in the 1980s, HIV was a lingering spectre which left him ""more wary"" of certain sexual activities. He said using PrEP made him feel ""more relaxed and not as scared"" about sex and, ""like everyone"", he was not always entirely safe. ""I am in a relationship and we don't use condoms and I still take PrEP as well, just because sometimes we might decide we want to open up our relationship. ""We have that as well as a back up. Then it's our decision among me, my partner and who else we might engage with. That's then something else we need to discuss. We always say that we're on PrEP."" While no-one has criticised him directly, Chris has seen people slamming PrEP users online and on dating apps. ""That's about them not being fully educated on it - they're just making their own opinions"". As of February, 841 people had been prescribed PrEP in Wales since July 2017 - as part of the study, Public Health Wales (PHW) is researching whether there is evidence PrEP increases infection rates and antimicrobial resistance for other STIs. Dr Giri Shankar, of PHW, said some groups ""exhibiting risky behaviour"" might be at a greater risk and the organisation was ""monitoring that closely"". ""At this point in time, we do not have conclusive data to say there is an increase in sexually transmitted diseases among our PrEP users,"" he said. Screenings show of the 841 people taking PrEP, 137 had gonorrhoea, 112 had chlamydia and 25 had syphilis, although there was no indication whether these numbers had increased since the study began. Dr Shankar said PHW recommended those having unprotected sex and with multiple partners should use preventive measures and have regular screenings. Ceri Dunstan, of the Terrence Higgins Trust said: ""There may be some reports of increases in other STIs but the point is the people on PrEP are actually seeing sexual health specialists, they are going into clinics for regular check-ups, which they might not have been doing otherwise. ""We're always been very clear as a trust that PrEP will only prevent HIV, it doesn't prevent anything else, but that at the very least is one big step forward."" Ms Dunstan said as the study in Wales progressed, the trust would like to see more demographic information collected about those accessing the service in order to ""target messages a bit more effectively"". For Chris, the experience of taking PrEP has been overwhelmingly positive. ""It's made me a lot more relaxed and less scared to go out and have some fun because it does give you that extra protection,"" he said. ""[But] taking it isn't the be-all and end-all of protecting yourself, because there are other STIs out there.""";News;"HIV & Aids; ";https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-47950515

Suffolk Wildlife Trust has bought land flanking its Carlton Marshes reserve to create a 1,000 acre (404 hectare) southern gateway to the Broads. It said it would provide a home to ""iconic East Anglian species"", adding the work included a visitors' centre. Sir David said the project presented a ""unique opportunity"" for wildlife. The 348 acre (140 hectare) land purchase was the biggest in the trust's 55-year history.

Ms McKee was shot while observing a riot in Londonderry last week. Fr Martin Magill was applauded when he asked why it had taken the journalist's death to bring politicians together. In an interview recorded for this Sunday's Andrew Marr programme he said: ""People want our politicians to move, and they want them to move now."" During the funeral service, Fr Magill had commended Northern Ireland's political leaders for ""standing together"" in the Creggan area of Londonderry on Good Friday to attend a vigil for Ms McKee. However, he then added: ""Why in God's name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?"" The British and Irish governments announced on Friday a new talks process, aimed at restoring devolution in Northern Ireland, would begin on 7 May. Sinn Féin collapsed the coalition government in January 2017 in protest at the DUP's handling of a green energy scandal. Since then, several rounds of talks have failed, with the two parties failing to find a compromise on a number of outstanding issues including Irish language rights and the legalisation of same-sex marriage. Fr Magill said politicians were slow to stand up when his words were applauded in Belfast's St Anne's Cathedral. ""The people, in a sense, really put the pressure on in the cathedral to stand,"" the priest said. ""Obviously the politicians realised; 'Oh goodness, everybody behind us is standing, we need to move,' and they literally moved because people had moved."" DUP leader Arlene Foster said it was ""a moment of great clarity during the service"", but acknowledged there were difficult issues to be discussed.

Dean Phoenix, 44, hit three-year-old Jaiden Mangan in Wareham, Dorset, in March 2018. He told jurors he was trying to manoeuvre around an illegally-parked car and had not seen the lights at the crossing change. Phoenix admitted a lesser charge of causing death by careless driving.  Jaiden, who would have turned four the next day, was on a balance bike and accompanied by his mother and sister when he was struck at about 08:40 BST in North Street. Phoenix, of Cibbons Road, Chineham, near Basingstoke, had been working since midnight and admitted he was ""frustrated"" when he found his Sainsbury's lorry was blocked by a car parked on zig-zag lines. He told Bournemouth Crown Court a bus coming from the other direction could not get round him, prompting him to pull his lorry forward onto the crossing. Phoenix said he could not see the traffic lights because of his position in the road, but assumed they were still green as the bus had just gone through.  He said it had been ""a mistake"" not to check the lights properly and was a decision he made in ""a split second"". The jury was shown dashcam footage which the prosecution said showed Phoenix being ""sarcastic"" by making a clapping gesture towards another motorist in the moments before the crash. His defence barrister argued the actions of pensioner Graham Booker, who had parked his car on the zig-zag lines, had ""contributed to the situation"". Booker, 71, of North Street, Wareham, admitted motoring offences in relation to the crash at a separate hearing in November. He was fined £380 and given a three-year driving ban. Speaking after the verdict, Dorset Police said Booker had played a ""massive part"" in the tragedy, while Phoenix should have taken extra care. Insp Joe Pardey said: ""A few simple checks could have and should have avoided this death."" Phoenix will be sentenced on Friday.";News;"Wareham; Basingstoke; ";https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-48052897

2019/04/25 18:02:57;Lawro's Premier League predictions v Radio 1 DJ Melvin Odoom - BBC Sport;BBC Sport football expert Mark Lawrenson takes on Radio 1 DJ Melvin Odoom in his Premier League predictions.;"Manchester City know they will retain their Premier League title if they win their final three games of the season and their next test sees them travel to Turf Moor on Sunday. Can City beat Burnley and make it 12 league wins on the spin? BBC football expert Mark Lawrenson feels their mentality will get them through. ""The thing with City is that they are just absolutely zoned in,"" he explained. ""I was at Old Trafford on Wednesday and you saw them just turn the switch on in the second half, and that is how the top teams get results. ""I am at Turf Moor on Sunday which will be the third time I have watched them in a week, and I am expecting to see them get another victory."" Lawro is making predictions for all 380 top-flight matches this season, against a variety of guests. This week he is up against Radio 1 DJ Melvin Odoom, who admits he is not exactly an expert compared to his co-hosts on the late night show, Charlie Hedges and Rickie Williams. ""We just love to take the mickey out of him because he knows nothing about football,"" explains Rickie. ""Melvin has no football knowledge, but he is very lucky, so he might do better with his predictions than he thinks,"" said Charlie. Melvin is definitely taking his task seriously, though. He added: ""I know it is a big deal because every time I look into Rickie's eyes, I see fire burning. ""It is like if I get it wrong, it is a really bad thing, but I think I have got the skills to beat Lawro at the very least.""               Media playback is not supported on this device             Melvin says he supports two teams - Tottenham and Ghana - but admits he is is not much of a footballer himself. ""I didn't really play at school,"" he said. ""But I was very good at kiss-chase and hopscotch. I never used to get picked for football teams, which is probably why I was never really into it. ""I am a Spurs fan because of my dad. Harry Kane is my favourite player and it is such a shame he is out at the moment."" You can listen to Melvin, Charlie and Rickie on the late night show on Radio 1, Monday to Thursday, from 9pm to 11pm. A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points.

2019/04/25 22:05:35;Raheem Sterling: Manchester City forward wins award for stance against racism - BBC Sport;"Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling receives an award for his stance against racism and says an ""example"" must be set.";"Manchester City's Raheem Sterling said he hopes to set an example for younger players as he received an award for his stance against racism in football. The England forward has criticised newspapers' portrayal of black players and wants stronger punishments for fans who racially abuse players. He was honoured at the BT Sport Industry Awards on Thursday. ""When the next generation come through, you have to set the example,"" the 24-year-old said. ""Coming through at Liverpool I had people around me like Steven Gerrard I looked up to. Looking at him I thought what can I do within myself to be half the person and player he was. ""You take little things and each year, try and develop not just on the field but off it. ""I was just speaking about my personal experiences, I didn't expect it to get so much attention. ""I just wanted to bring it to the attention of my audience on Instagram. It's been really pleasing to see people listening and trying and do better."" England manager Gareth Southgate presented the award and said Sterling's actions had made ""a massive impact on British society"". ""I've worked with Raheem now for around five years and to have seen his maturity as a person has been lovely to watch,"" said Southgate. ""This is about his own personal improvement, his improvement on the field and his recognition he can make a difference off the field. That has been increasingly powerful over the last six months and had a massive impact on British society I think."" Sterling suffered allegedly racist abuse from Chelsea fans during City's 2-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge in December, prompting an Instagram post in which he questioned newspapers' portrayal of black players. In January, it was revealed he wrote a letter to a young City fan who was racially abused, urging the supporter ""stand tall, don't let them take away your courage"". He was also racially abused during England's European Championship qualifier in Montenegro in March, along with international team-mates Danny Rose and Callum Hudson-Odoi. Earlier in April he was hailed as ""an iconic British sports star"" and ""a trailblazer"" after being named sportsman of the year at the 2019 British Ethnic Diversity Sports Awards.";"BBC Sport; Man City";;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48060828
